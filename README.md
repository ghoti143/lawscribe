# Product Vision Document: **LawScribe** - AI-Powered Legal Document Review & Automation Tool

## 1. Vision Statement
Our vision is to democratize access to AI-driven legal tools, empowering small law firms, solo practitioners, in-house counsel, and legal assistants with the ability to quickly and efficiently review contracts, automate legal documents, and reduce the risk of costly legal errors. By providing an open-source foundation, we aim to build a transparent, scalable legal tool that grows with the contributions of the community.

## 2. Target Audience / Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)
We aim to serve the following groups:
- **Solo Practitioners and Small Law Firms**: Legal professionals who lack the resources for expensive tools and paralegal support, and need to automate routine tasks to save time and reduce human error.
- **In-House Counsel for Startups**: Lean legal teams that often rely on non-lawyers to handle legal tasks, needing fast, intuitive tools to assist with contract review and legal document generation.
- **Paralegals and Legal Assistants**: Support staff responsible for reviewing contracts and drafting legal documents, who need to speed up repetitive tasks and ensure accuracy.
- **Freelance Lawyers and Consultants**: Legal professionals working on a contract basis, who need agile tools to streamline their workflows and take on more clients efficiently.

## 3. Problem Statement
Legal professionals often spend hours manually reviewing contracts, identifying key clauses, and redrafting legal documents. For small firms, this can be both time-consuming and error-prone, leading to costly mistakes and inefficiencies. Additionally, high costs associated with traditional legal tech solutions create barriers for smaller firms and startups, leaving them without the tools they need to compete effectively.

**Key Problems:**
- Time-consuming manual contract review.
- High risk of errors in reviewing key legal clauses.
- Lack of affordable tools for automating routine legal work.
- Limited technical resources in small law firms or in-house legal teams.

## 4. Solution
**LawScribe** will leverage natural language processing (NLP) to provide a fast, affordable, and accurate way for legal professionals to:
- **Review Contracts**: Automatically extract and analyze key clauses (e.g., termination clauses, confidentiality provisions) and provide plain-language explanations, helping to flag risks or missing terms.
- **Automate Legal Document Creation**: Use templates to quickly generate standard legal documents (NDAs, employment contracts, etc.), customized with inputs from users.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed to be accessible to both legal and non-legal staff, allowing non-lawyers to use the platform effectively with minimal training.
- **Open Source Foundation**: The core functionality will be open source, enabling community contributions and providing transparency. This allows legal professionals to access essential features for free, while advanced capabilities and support services will be available via a paid tier.

## 5. Core Features (MVP)
